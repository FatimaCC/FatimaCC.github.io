               I feel like it has been a long time since I last posted, but I just wanted to tell y'all that for the past month I been working on an art project for the VASE Competition. Today was the competition and I had the opportunity to present my project, sadly it didn't make it to the floor but I am glad that I was able to present it. I really enjoyed it and  I saw a lot of amazing and beautiful art pieces. </p>

                Guys! I'm working on a very special project. I'm doing an Algebra I calculator from scratch using Python. I originally started it on may 2022 but I didn't have the chance to finish it, so I decided to work on it during the Thanksging Break, I hope to finish it during this break.
